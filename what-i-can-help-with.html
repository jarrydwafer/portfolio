  <h2 class="page-title">Grammar </h2>
  <p>Grammar is the system that structures a language, and every language has its own guidelines. But grammar isnâ€™t so much about rules as it is the conventions that determine how we speak and write, and it includes things like spelling, inflecting words for different purposes, and the way words are arranged to form sentences. Proper grammar is necessary for effective communication.</p>

<h2 class="page-title">Reading comprehension </h2>
<p>Reading comprehension is the understanding of what a particular text means and the ideas the author is attempting to convey, both textual and subtextual. In order to read any text, your brain must process not only the literal words of the piece, but also their relationship with one another, the context behind the words, how subtle language and vocabulary usage can impact emotion and meaning behind the text, and how the text comes together as a larger, coherent whole. </p>
