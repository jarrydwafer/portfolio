    In our first free meeting, I will assess your level of English using the Cambridge Primary Assessment which is based on the Council of Europeâ€™s Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
  </p>
  <p>
    From there, we create a timeline of progression and set measurable objectives in the areas you want to improve. Using the Common European Framework of Reference for Language, I design engaging lessons, personalized to meet your goals. Through this approach, students are proven to obtain a higher proficiency in six to twelve sessions.
